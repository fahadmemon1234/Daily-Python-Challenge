# 🎂 Simple Age Calculator

## 📌 Task 09 – Simple Age Calculator 🎂📅

### 🚀 Mission:
Create a simple program that calculates a person’s age based on their birth year.

### 💡 Instructions:
1. Ask the user to enter their birth year.
2. Calculate their current age (assuming the current year is 2025).
3. Display their age.

### 🔎 Example Output:
```plaintext
Enter your birth year: 2000  
You are 25 years old. 🎉
```

### 📌 Bonus Challenge:
